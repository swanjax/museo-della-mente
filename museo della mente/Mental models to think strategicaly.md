> In an age of infinite leverage, judgement is the most important skill
> - Naval Ravikant

Having good judgement is essentially the ability to think clearly and strategically no matter the circumstance. Meaning, emotions and irrationality due to the environment should not play a part in the decision making process. Individuals often, decide based on emotion and then proceed to justify using logic. This is not only a hindrance along the path to success but a detriment which leads us worse off in our journey to achieve greatness by leading us to sacrifice resources in futile endeavours. There is however, a simples frameworks or models one can employ in order to think like a strategic genius. The following frameworks are in the form of analogies that relate these strategies to chess.

### Framework 1 - Control the centre
Controlling the centre of a chess board is one of the greatest advantages a player can get over their opponent. Having your piece in the centre of the board allows it to influence more squares than it would if it were at the corner (e.g. A knight in the centre attacks 8 squares while a knight in the corner only attacks 2). This is the high ground. The high ground is advantageous as it gives you more reach and influence without necessarily exposing you to more risk.

In life an individual can have many goals, say, they want to lose 10 kilos. The strategic way to approach this goal would be identifying and controlling the squares that have the greatest positive impact in the endeavour to lose 10 kilos. One must acknowledge that there are numerous squares that help in your journey to lose weight, from getting more quality to sleep to surgery to working out and the list goes on. However, you only have 24 hours in a day and your resources are limited. So which of these squares are at the centre? Which of these squares when controlled empower you and push you towards success?

Boiling the problem down, weight loss occurs when the caloric expenditure is greater than the caloric intake. Meaning, to lose weight you can either burn more calories or reduce your calorie intake. Work out more or focus on your nutrition? (remember your resources are limited!) Well, the science behind this is clear. Focusing on nutrition will be far more beneficial than working out more. However, this is not to say that working out does not have its merits. Good nutrition can practically win the game on its own. Hence, the best strategic decision, if you can only choose one, is to focus on nutrition.

In business, what are the key squares? There are 3 main squares on this board.
1. Marketing (How are you getting customers?)
2. Operations (What is the product? How do you deliver it?)
3. Finance (How do you break-even or profit while managing #1 and #2?)

When starting out, you would not have the resources to focus on all 3 of these squares simultaneously. Meaning, you will have to strategically think and decide controlling which of these squares will be most advantageous to you. If you don't have a product, then it is futile for you to devote resources to marketing. If you have a product but no services, then focus on marketing.

When first starting out as an entrepreneur, you will be every piece on the board and unfortunately, you can be everywhere all at once. This framework will allow you to focus on what is most important until you can hire others to control square for you.
